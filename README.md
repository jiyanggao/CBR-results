# CBR-results
This repo holds the test results for the paper "Cascaded Boundary Regression for Temporal Action Detection, BMVC 2017". One can use these files and THUMOS-14 official eval code to re-produce our results on THUMOS-14 shown in the paper. The source code for CBR can be found [here](https://github.com/jiyanggao/CBR). For temporal action proposal generation, please see [TURN](https://github.com/jiyanggao/TURN-TAP).
